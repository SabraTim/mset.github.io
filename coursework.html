            <p>
              The required courses provided me with a strong overview of the
              education technology dicipline. Many of the projects and
              activities that I completed for courses were practical, ones that
              I could use right away in my own classes.
            </p>

              The course descriptions, dates when I completed the class, grade,
              text and instructor are listed below. Please see the Key Themes
              page for a list of artifacts from my coursework.
