            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've been an educator for more years than I can count.</p>
            <p>
              I started becoming more invested in using technology for teaching
              when I discovered that I could use it to better serve my adult GED
              learners who often had to practice math via video chat in the
              evenings after they put their children to bed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more doors I could see opening for my students because of
              effective technology tools, the more I wanted to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the COVID 19 pandemic I continued to find new ways to help
              my elementary ESOL students access content and community in a
              virtual way.

        <h3>At Home</h3>
        <p>
          I'm originally from New Hampshire, but came to Virginia for school,
          fell in love, and never left. My husband and I have raised our three
          sons in Charlottesville. I enjoy playing and coaching soccer, dancing
          salsa and weekend bagels and disc golf with my family.
