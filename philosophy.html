            <h2>Philosophy Statement</h2>
          <p>
           To be a successful educator, I believe one needs to:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left:2em;">
            <li>create a positive class community and opportunities for
              collaboration
            </li>
            <li>encourage patient problem solving and learning from mistakes as
              an important part of the learning process
            </li>
            <li>use technology in meaningful ways              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </style>
          <p>Wondrous things can happen if teachers take the time
            to establish a welcoming, supportive class community first. Students are more invested and
            learn from teachers and fellow classmates when they believe people truly
            care about them and their learning.

        <h3>A Champion</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Every child deserves a champion: an adult who will never give up
            on them, who understands the power of connection and insists they
            become the best that they can possibly be." - Rita Pierson,
            educator
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Collaboration is an significant skill for today's workplace and the
          future of our planet. It is essential that we teach and foster
          collaboration among our young learners.
        </p>
        <p>We need to create learning environments where students aren't afraid
          to make mistakes, but instead work to discover what can be learned
          from them.
        </p>
        <p>Having access to an amazing amount of technological resources is a
          wonderful benefit of teaching today, but we need to remember to choose
          carefully.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that technology use should be meaningful and should only be
          a replacement for other types of traditional learning when it can save
          time, provide a deeper experience or facilitate one that can be more
          easily shared.
