          <h2>Philosophy Statement</h2>
          <p>
            One of the valuable takeaways from this difficult, global pandemic
            academic year is that it helped many focus on those elements that
            are the most important. For me to be a successful educator one needs
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>to create a positive class community and opportunities for
              collaboration
            </li>
            <li>to encourage patient problem solving and learning from mistakes as
              an important part of the learning process
            </li>
            <li>to use technology in meaningful ways              
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>I believe that building a welcoming, supportive class community is
            the first step in any learning. Wondrous things can happen if time
            is taken to establish this first. Students are more invested and
            learn from teachers and fellow classmates that they believe truly
            care about them and their learning.

            <p>"Every child deserves a champion: an adult who will never give up
              on them, who understands the power of connection and insists they
              become the best that they can possibly be." - Rita Pierson,
              educator

        <p>Collaboration is an significant skill for today's workplace and the
          future of our planet. It is essential that we teach and foster
          collaboration among our young learners.
        </p>
        <p>We give our students too many multiple choice assessments and in life,
          the big questions never have multiple choice answers if they have
          answers at all. We need to produce more patient problem solvers.
        </p>
        <p>We need to create learning environments where students aren't afraid
          to make mistakes, but instead work to discover what can be learned
          from them.
        </p>
        <p>Having access to an amazing amount of technological resources is a
          wonderful benefit of teaching today, but we need to remember to choose
          carefully.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that technology use should be meaningful and should only be
          a replacement for other types of traditional learning when it can save
          time, provide a deeper experience or facilitate one that can be more
          easily shared.
